# React Job Site Documentation

## Overview

This project is a React-based job listing website designed for educational purposes. It leverages the modern JavaScript framework React, alongside Vite for an efficient development experience. The application allows users to post, edit, and delete job offers, simulating a real-world job portal environment.

### Inspiration

The development of this project was guided by a tutorial available on YouTube. For a comprehensive step-by-step guide, refer to the video here: [Building a Job Site with React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDB4uaJ87e0).

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow the steps below. These instructions will guide you through setting up the development environment and starting the application.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have either Yarn or npm installed on your system to handle package management and script execution. These tools are essential for installing dependencies and running the project.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine. Use the Git command below:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jean-Pierre-97s/React-Job-Site
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and run one of the following commands to install the necessary dependencies:

   Using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn add
   ```

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

After installing the dependencies, you can start the application by running the backend mock server and the development server. Open two separate terminal windows or tabs for this purpose.

1. **Start the Backend Mock Server**

   Using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn server
   ```

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

2. **Launch the Development Server**

   Using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command compiles the React application and serves it on a local development server.

Now, your application should be running, and you can access it through the web browser at the address provided by the development server http://localhost:3000.
